# Skin-disease-using-GAN

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

"Despite advancements in image-based diagnostics, accurately identifying and classifying skin lesions associated with cancer remains a challenge. Manual assessment by dermatologists is time-consuming and subjective. This project aims to develop a robust and automated system utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic images of skin lesions and train a discriminator for accurate detection and classification.‚Äù

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

We have loaded dataset from kaggle and prepossed it https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000

GAN Model Architecture :

Generator, discriminator, datagen() function Training process: Training loop to train all the losses and plotting graph to show it

Results and Analysis:

Generated images: Visual representations of skin disease images after adding noise, produced by the GAN Training loop: Training each epoch and showing them into d_loss and g_loss
